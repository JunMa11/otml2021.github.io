Over the last few years, optimal transport (OT) has quickly become a central topic in machine learning. 
OT is now routinely used in many areas of ML, ranging from the theoretical use of OT flow for controlling learning algorithms to the inference of high-dimensional cell trajectories in genomics. 
The OTML workshop series has been instrumental in formalizing this research thread.
For this new installment of OTML, we aim even bigger by hosting an exceptional
keynote speaker, Alessio Figalli, who is the 2018 Fields Medalist for his
breakthrough in the analysis of the regularity.
OTML will be a unique opportunity for cross-fertilization between key recent
advances in pure mathematics and challenging high-dimensional learning problems.
